# Story 3.9: Offer History & Previous Applications

## Status
Ready for Development

## Story

**As a** borrower,
**I want** to view my offer history and all my previous loan applications,
**so that** I can track my loan history and compare offers from different applications.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. GET /api/borrower/offer-history returns all offers borrower has received (historical)
2. GET /api/borrower/applications returns all borrower applications with status and details
3. Offer history includes: application date, loan amount, term, offers count, best APR, selected offer (if any)
4. Applications list includes: status, submission date, loan amount, term, offer count, expiration status
5. Pagination: limit, offset, total count, sorting by date (newest first)
6. Filter applications by: status, date range, loan amount range
7. Each application shows: reference number, current status, created at, submitted at, final offer accepted (if applicable)
8. Audit trail access: borrower can view action timestamps (submitted, offer selected, application closed)
9. Can view details of any previous application and its offers
10. Integration test: retrieve application history, filter by status, verify offer counts

## Dev Notes

### Previous Stories Dependencies
- **Story 2.1-2.2**: Application entity
- **Story 3.3-3.4**: Offer creation and retrieval
- **Story 3.5-3.6**: Offer selection and expiration
- **Story 1.7**: AuditService for timestamps

### Technology Stack
[Source: architecture/1-system-architecture-overview.md]
- **Framework**: Spring Boot 3.2.1, Spring Data JPA
- **Queries**: Custom @Query with JPA aggregations (COUNT, MIN)
- **Caching**: Caffeine cache (Spring Cache abstraction)
- **Pagination**: Spring Data Pageable

### Query Optimization
[Source: AC: 5, 8]
- **Offer History Query**:
  - SELECT offers with JOIN FETCH to organization
  - Index: (borrowerId, offerReceivedAt DESC)
  - Avoids N+1 queries
- **Application History Query**:
  - SELECT applications with subquery for offer count and best APR
  - SELECT COUNT(*) and MIN(apr) from offers grouped by applicationId
  - Index: (borrowerId, submittedAt DESC)
- **Aggregations**: Use SQL aggregation functions (COUNT, MIN) not application-side

### Filtering Strategy
[Source: AC: 6]
- **Status Filter**: application.status IN (requested values)
- **Date Range**: createdAt >= start AND createdAt <= end
- **Loan Amount**: loanAmount >= min AND loanAmount <= max
- **Combination**: All filters combined with AND

### Sorting
[Source: AC: 5]
- **Offer History**: Default by offerReceivedAt descending (newest first)
- **Application History**: Default by submittedAt descending (newest first)

### Expiration Status Logic
[Source: AC: 4]
- **all_active**: All offers expiresAt > now
- **all_expired**: All offers expiresAt <= now
- **mixed**: Some active, some expired
- **no_offers**: No offers for application

### Important Notes
1. **Sorting**: Default is newest first (by date DESC)
2. **Filtering**: Multiple filters combined with AND
3. **Pagination**: Max 100 results per page
4. **Query Optimization**: JOIN FETCH and SQL aggregations (not application-side)
5. **Access Control**: Borrower can only see own applications and offers
6. **Offer Count**: Count of offers per application
7. **Best APR**: Lowest APR from all offers for application
8. **Expiration Status**: Indicates if offers are still valid
9. **Audit Trail**: Timestamps from Story 1.7 (AuditService)
10. **Caching**: 1-hour TTL, invalidate on status changes

## Testing

### Testing Framework & Location
- **Framework**: JUnit 5, Spring Boot Test, TestContainers
- **Mocking**: Mockito for repositories and services
