2. Standardized comparison metrics include: APR, monthly payment, total cost, all fees
3. No hidden fees: all costs disclosed upfront
4. Effective APR calculated: includes all fees
5. Tooltip explains each fee
6. Borrower rights section in privacy policy: right to compare, withdraw, data access/deletion

  ## Dev Notes

  ### Previous Stories Dependencies
  - Story 3.4 (Offer DTOs/Endpoints): base offer data extended with disclosure metrics here.
  - Story 3.2 (Rate Cards): APR inputs and fees originate from bank rate cards.
  - Story 4.4 (Offer Submission): disclosure validation must run during offer creation.
  - Story 5.2 (Privacy Policy): update with Borrower Rights section and links.
  - Story 5.3 (Data Export): ensure disclosure data is included in exports.
  - Story 5.4 (Erasure): disclosures must not leak PII post-deletion; show anonymized historical metrics only.
  - Story 5.5 (Audit): record disclosure rendering and user views only as necessary, without sensitive payloads.

  ### Compliance Context
  - Moldovan consumer protection (NBM/CNPF): require clear APR prominence, all fees disclosed, rights and contacts visible.
  - GDPR fairness/transparency: explanations for fees and calculations; enable comparison without dark patterns.
  - Accessibility: ensure textual explanations are available (screen-readers), not only tooltips.

  ### Calculation Notes
  - APR prominence is UX/display; service returns both numeric and formatted fields.
  - Effective APR should incorporate all fees; use IRR for precision when feasible, with documented fallback formula.
  - Total Cost of Credit: principal + interest + all fees; currency-aware formatting.

  ### API Integration
  - Extend GET /api/borrower/offers and /offers/{id} to add disclosure block.
  - Add /offers/comparison for selected offers; sort by APR or total cost.
  - Validation guard `OfferDisclosureValidator` ensures complete disclosures.

  ### Security & Privacy
  - Never expose internal pricing algorithms; disclose parameters and results only.
  - Avoid PII in logs; include offerId and bankId references only.
  - Respect regionalization/localization for currency and wording.
