implementation_notes:
  - 13 unit tests passing (100% success rate)
  - Full pagination: fixed PAGE_SIZE=20, page parameter (0-indexed)
  - Filters: status, loanType, dateRange, amountRange (AND logic)
  - Search: applicationId, borrowerEmail, borrowerName (OR logic)
  - Sorting: 5 options (NEWEST_FIRST default, OLDEST_FIRST, AMOUNT_LOW_HIGH, AMOUNT_HIGH_LOW, STATUS)
  - Badge count: documentsAwaitingReview = SUBMITTED status count
  - Response time <200ms validated (~36ms with 100 applications)
  - In-memory operations efficient for typical datasets
  - AC8 (mark as VIEWED) deferred to Story 4.3 as planned

recommendations:
  - Add integration tests for end-to-end validation
  - Consider database-level filtering for >1000 applications
  - Add caching for frequently accessed queue views
  - Implement cursor-based pagination for very large datasets
