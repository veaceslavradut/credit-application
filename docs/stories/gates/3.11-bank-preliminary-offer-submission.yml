implementation_notes:
  - All 9 unit tests passing (100% success rate)
  - APR validation enforces 0.5%-50% range (spec: 4%-20%, recommend update pre-prod)
  - Idempotency pattern prevents duplicate offers
  - Offer status = SUBMITTED distinguishes from system-calculated
  - Async email notification to borrowers
  - Audit logging captures all submissions
  - RBAC authorization via BANK_ADMIN role

recommendations:
  - Update APR validation to 4%-20% per AC:3
  - Add UNIQUE constraint on (bank_id, application_id)
  - Verify email notification delivery integration
