# Story 1.1: Project Setup & CI/CD Pipeline

## Status
Ready for Development

## Story

**As a** development team lead,
**I want** a fully configured Spring Boot project with automated build, test, and deployment pipeline,
**so that** all developers can commit code with confidence that tests run automatically and deployments are repeatable.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Spring Boot 3.2.1 project initialized with Maven, directory structure organized by domain (auth, borrower, bank, shared)
2. Exact dependency versions pinned: Java OpenJDK 21.0.1, Spring Boot 3.2.1, PostgreSQL 15.4, Redis 7.2.3, React 18.2.0, Node.js 20.11.0 LTS, Vite 5.0.8
3. PostgreSQL database provisioned locally (docker-compose) and connected to staging RDS from Story 1.0
4. CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions or GitLab CI) configured to: run unit tests on every commit, build Docker image on main branch, run integration tests, deploy to staging
5. Blue-green deployment strategy configured with automated rollback capability if health checks fail
6. Logging configured: JSON structured logs sent to CloudWatch (or local ELK for development) with structured fields (timestamp, level, service, trace_id)
7. README documents: local development setup with docker-compose, deployment process, environment variable configuration, troubleshooting guide
8. Deployment runbook created documenting: staging deployment process, production deployment process, rollback procedure, incident response contacts
9. All tests pass in CI pipeline (initially placeholder tests to prove pipeline works)
10. Staging deployment is accessible and shows a "Health Check" endpoint returning 200 OK with system status (database: connected, redis: connected, version: 1.0.0)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous stories in this epic. Story 1.0 (Infrastructure Provisioning) must be completed first.

### Technology Stack
[Source: architecture/1-system-architecture-overview.md]
- **Backend Runtime**: Java OpenJDK 21.0.1
- **Framework**: Spring Boot 3.2.1 with Spring Cloud
- **Build Tool**: Maven 3.8+
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL 15.4 (Multi-AZ RDS in staging/prod)
- **Cache/Session Store**: Redis 7.2.3 (ElastiCache cluster mode in staging/prod)
- **Containerization**: Docker, Kubernetes
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

### Service Architecture Context
[Source: architecture/2-detailed-service-architecture.md]
The User Service (Auth) is the first domain service to implement. This story sets up the foundation for:
- POST /api/users/register
- POST /api/users/login
- GET /api/users/profile
- JWT token generation and validation

### CI/CD Pipeline Architecture
[Source: architecture/5-infrastructure-deployment.md]
**Pipeline Stages:**
1. Code Quality: SonarQube scan, code coverage >80%
2. Security: OWASP dependency check, container scanning
3. Build: Maven build, Docker image push
4. Integration Tests: Testcontainers with PostgreSQL, Redis
5. Staging Deploy: Blue-green deployment with rollback
6. Production Deploy: Canary deployment

**Blue-Green Strategy**: Two identical environments. Traffic switches after health checks pass. Rollback available if issues detected.

### Security Configuration
[Source: architecture/4-security-architecture.md]
- Passwords: bcrypt (salt factor 12) - implemented in Story 1.3
- Sessions: JWT (RS256) with 15-minute expiration - implemented in Story 1.5
- Audit Logs: append-only, immutable - implemented in Story 1.7
- For this story, focus on infrastructure foundation

### Logging & Observability
[Source: architecture/7-monitoring-observability.md]
**Log Structure Requirements:**
- JSON format for machine readability
- Required fields: timestamp (ISO-8601), level, logger name, service name, trace_id
- Log levels: INFO, WARN, ERROR, DEBUG
- Aggregation: CloudWatch Logs (production), local console (development)

### Database Connection Pooling
[Source: architecture/2-detailed-service-architecture.md]
- Use HikariCP (default in Spring Boot) for connection pooling
- Max pool size: 10 (dev), 20 (staging), 50 (production)
- Timeout: 30 seconds for connection acquisition

### Testing Standards
[Source: frontend-architecture/10-testing-strategy.md]
- **Unit Tests**: Individual components/functions with mocks
- **Integration Tests**: Real containers (Testcontainers) for database and cache
- **Test Framework**: JUnit 5, Mockito
- **Naming**: Test class suffix .Test (e.g., HealthControllerTest.java)
- **Coverage Goal**: 80%+ code coverage (JaCoCo)
- **Location**: src/test/java/ mirroring src/main/java/

### Key Dependencies to Pin
`xml
<!-- Core Spring Boot -->
<spring-boot.version>3.2.1</spring-boot.version>
<java.version>21.0.1</java.version>

<!-- Database & Caching -->
<postgresql.version>15.4</postgresql.version>

### Important Notes
1. This is a foundation story - must be completed before other backend development
2. The CI/CD pipeline will be reused for all subsequent stories
3. Docker image should be pushed to container registry for staging deployment
4. Health check endpoint must be resilient and not block on slow queries
5. Logging must support both development and production environments
6. All placeholder tests must be replaced with real tests in subsequent stories

## Testing

### Testing Framework & Location
- **Framework**: JUnit 5 (Jupiter) + Spring Boot Test
- **Mocking**: Mockito
- **Integration Testing**: Testcontainers (PostgreSQL, Redis)
- **Test Location**: src/test/java/com/creditapp/
- **Test Class Naming**: {ComponentName}Test.java for unit tests, {Feature}IntegrationTest.java for integration tests

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Unit tests for HealthController
- [ ] Integration tests for Spring context with containers
- [ ] All tests pass with mvn clean test
- [ ] Code coverage report generated by JaCoCo
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline test stage passes
