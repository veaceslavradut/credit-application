# Story 3.6: Offer Expiration & Cleanup

## Status
Ready for Development

## Story

**As a** system administrator,
**I want** to automatically expire preliminary offers after their validity period,
**so that** borrowers don't accidentally select outdated offers and banks aren't bound to stale terms.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Offer automatically marked EXPIRED when expiresAt <= now
2. Borrower cannot select expired offer (returns 410 Gone)
3. Batch job runs daily at midnight UTC to mark expired offers
4. Frontend countdown timer receives expiresAt timestamp
5. Status transitions: CALCULATED -> EXPIRED, ACCEPTED -> EXPIRED_WITH_SELECTION
6. Audit log: OFFER_EXPIRED event with expiration reason
7. Audit log: OFFER_SELECTION_FAILED if borrower tries expired offer
8. Email sent to bank if borrower's selected offer expires
9. Can manually recalculate offers on demand (triggers new offers)
10. Integration test: create offers, wait past expiration, verify batch job marks EXPIRED

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Add EXPIRED Status to OfferStatus Enum (AC: 1, 5)
  - [ ] Update OfferStatus enum (src/main/java/com/creditapp/bank/model/OfferStatus.java)
    - Add: EXPIRED (indicates offer no longer valid, time-based)
    - Add: EXPIRED_WITH_SELECTION (offer was selected but then expired)
    - Enum values: CALCULATED, SUBMITTED, ACCEPTED, EXPIRED, EXPIRED_WITH_SELECTION, REJECTED, WITHDRAWN
  - [ ] Document state transitions:
    - CALCULATED -> EXPIRED (automatic via batch job)
    - ACCEPTED -> EXPIRED_WITH_SELECTION (automatic via batch job after borrower selected)
    - EXPIRED -> CALCULATED (on recalculation request)
  - [ ] Unit test: verify enum values exist and transitions are valid

- [ ] Task 2: Create Offer Expiration Service (AC: 1, 3, 6)
  - [ ] Create OfferExpirationService (src/main/java/com/creditapp/bank/service/OfferExpirationService.java)
    - Method: expireOffers() - called by batch job
      - Query all offers with status IN (CALCULATED, ACCEPTED, SUBMITTED)
      - For each offer where expiresAt <= now:
        - If status = ACCEPTED or SUBMITTED, set to EXPIRED_WITH_SELECTION
        - Else set to EXPIRED
        - Save offer with updated status
        - Log audit event: OFFER_EXPIRED with expiration reason
        - If status was ACCEPTED:
          - Send email to bank (AC8)
          - Set application status back to SUBMITTED (offer no longer valid)
      - Log summary: "{count} offers expired"
      - Return count of expired offers
    - Method: manualExpireOffer(UUID offerId) - for manual expiration if needed
      - Fetch offer, set to EXPIRED, log event, send notification
    - Error handling: Log errors but don't fail batch job (all-or-nothing approach)
  - [ ] Unit tests: mock repository, test expiration logic, test email notification

- [ ] Task 3: Create Scheduled Batch Job (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Create OfferExpirationScheduler (src/main/java/com/creditapp/bank/scheduler/OfferExpirationScheduler.java)
    - Annotation: @Component, @EnableScheduling
    - Method: expireOffersDaily()
      - Annotation: @Scheduled(cron = "0 0 0 * * *") - Daily at midnight UTC
      - Alternative: @Scheduled(cron = "0 0 0 * * ?") for Quartz compatibility
      - Call OfferExpirationService.expireOffers()
      - Log result: "Expired {count} offers at {timestamp}"
      - Handle exceptions: Log and alert, don't crash scheduler
    - Add configuration to enable scheduling in application.properties
  - [ ] Alternative approach: Use Spring Task Scheduler instead of @Scheduled
    - OfferExpirationTaskScheduler with @Bean
    - scheduleAtFixedRate or scheduleWithFixedDelay
  - [ ] Configuration property: creditapp.scheduler.offer-expiration-cron
    - Default: "0 0 0 * * *" (midnight UTC)
    - Allow override via application.properties

- [ ] Task 4: Update Application Status Transition (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Update ApplicationStatusTransitionService
    - Add valid transition: OFFER_ACCEPTED -> SUBMITTED
      - Reason: When selected offer expires (AC5)
      - Called by OfferExpirationService.expireOffers()
    - Update state machine diagram to show this transition
  - [ ] Add ApplicationStatusReason enum or field
    - Reason: OFFER_EXPIRED, USER_REQUESTED, etc.

- [ ] Task 5: Create Offer Expiration Email Service (AC: 8)
  - [ ] Create OfferExpirationEmailService (src/main/java/com/creditapp/shared/service/OfferExpirationEmailService.java)
    - Method: sendOfferExpiredToBorower(Offer offer, Application app) - notify borrower
      - Subject: "Your selected offer from {bankName} has expired"
      - Body: Inform borrower that offer is no longer valid, offer to recalculate
    - Method: sendOfferExpiredToBank(Offer offer, Application app) - notify bank
      - Subject: "The offer for {borrowerName} has expired"
      - Body: Notification that selected offer expired, borrower may request recalculation
    - All methods non-blocking: @Async
  - [ ] Unit tests: mock email service, verify recipients and content

- [ ] Task 6: Add Expiration Check to Offer Selection (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Update OfferSelectionService.selectOffer() (from Story 3.5)
    - Before selection, check if offer.expiresAt <= now
    - If expired, throw OfferExpiredException with message: "This offer expired at {expiresAt}"
    - Return 410 Gone HTTP status
    - Log audit event: OFFER_SELECTION_FAILED with reason EXPIRED (AC7)
  - [ ] Unit test: attempt to select expired offer, verify OfferExpiredException

- [ ] Task 7: Create Offer Recalculation Endpoint (AC: 9)
  - [ ] Create or update OfferCalculationController (from Story 3.3)
    - POST /api/borrower/applications/{applicationId}/recalculate-offers
    - @PreAuthorize("hasAuthority('BORROWER')")
    - Validation: application status must be SUBMITTED
    - Call OfferCalculationService.recalculateOffers(applicationId)
      - Delete old offers (or mark as EXPIRED)
      - Trigger new offer calculation (same as Story 3.3)
      - Return new offers with fresh expiresAt timestamps
    - Response: List<OfferComparisonDTO> (like Story 3.4)
  - [ ] Error handling:
    - 400: Application not in SUBMITTED status
    - 403: Borrower doesn't own application
    - 404: Application not found
    - 503: Offer calculation service unavailable
  - [ ] Unit tests: mock service, test success and error paths

- [ ] Task 8: Update Offer Retrieval to Handle Expired Offers (AC: 2, 4)
  - [ ] Update OfferRetrievalService.getOffersForApplication() (from Story 3.4)
    - Query active offers: status IN (CALCULATED, ACCEPTED, SUBMITTED)
    - Exclude EXPIRED and EXPIRED_WITH_SELECTION from results
    - If all offers expired:
      - Return empty list with message: "All offers have expired. Please recalculate."
      - Include suggestion to call POST /recalculate-offers endpoint
  - [ ] Update OfferComparisonResponse
    - Add field: offersExpired (boolean) - true if all offers expired
    - Add field: recalculateUrl (string) - link to recalculate endpoint
  - [ ] Unit tests: verify expired offers excluded, correct message returned

- [ ] Task 9: Frontend Support for Countdown Timer (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Document API contract: expiresAt timestamp in OfferComparisonDTO
    - Field: expiresAt (ISO 8601 timestamp, e.g., "2026-01-15T10:30:00Z")
    - Frontend uses this to display countdown timer
  - [ ] Response includes: retrievedAt timestamp
    - Frontend can calculate remaining time: expiresAt - retrievedAt
  - [ ] Document in API_ENDPOINTS.md:
    - "Offers expire at the timestamp in expiresAt field"
    - "Frontend should display countdown and disable selection if <= 0"
    - "Example: if expiresAt = 2026-01-15T10:30:00Z and now = 2026-01-15T10:25:00Z, remaining = 5 minutes"

- [ ] Task 10: Create Unit Tests (AC: 1, 3, 5, 6)
  - [ ] Create OfferExpirationServiceTest (src/test/java/com/creditapp/unit/bank/OfferExpirationServiceTest.java)
    - Test 1: Expire CALCULATED offer - verify status changed to EXPIRED
    - Test 2: Expire ACCEPTED offer - verify status changed to EXPIRED_WITH_SELECTION
    - Test 3: Expire SUBMITTED offer - verify status changed to EXPIRED_WITH_SELECTION
    - Test 4: Non-expired offers unchanged - verify offers with expiresAt > now unchanged
    - Test 5: Audit event logged - verify OFFER_EXPIRED event logged
    - Test 6: Email sent if ACCEPTED - verify sendOfferExpiredToBank called
    - Test 7: Application status reverted - verify application status changed back to SUBMITTED
    - Test 8: No email if CALCULATED - verify no email sent for non-selected offers
    - Test 9: Returns count - verify correct count of expired offers
    - Test 10: Handles database errors gracefully
  - [ ] Mock: OfferRepository, ApplicationRepository, AuditService, OfferExpirationEmailService

    - Test 2: Correct cron expression (midnight UTC)
    - Test 3: Exception handling - errors logged but scheduler continues
    - Test 4: Runs daily - verify @Scheduled annotation present
  - [ ] Mock: OfferExpirationService
  - [ ] Framework: JUnit 5, Mockito, Spring Scheduler testing

- [ ] Task 12: Create Integration Tests (AC: 1, 2, 8, 9, 10)
  - [ ] Create OfferExpirationIntegrationTest (src/test/java/com/creditapp/integration/bank/OfferExpirationIntegrationTest.java)
    - Setup: Create application, submit, create offers with recent expiresAt
    - Test 1: Batch job runs and marks offers EXPIRED
    - Test 2: Borrower cannot select expired offer (410 Gone)
    - Test 3: Expired offer excluded from GET offers endpoint
    - Test 4: Email sent to bank when selected offer expires
    - Test 5: Application status reverted to SUBMITTED when selected offer expires
    - Test 6: Recalculate offers endpoint works
    - Test 7: New offers from recalculation have fresh expiresAt
    - Test 8: Multiple applications: only affected offers expire
    - Test 9: Concurrent offers: mixed expiration states handled
    - Test 10: Verify audit trail: OFFER_EXPIRED events
  - [ ] Use: TestContainers (PostgreSQL), TestRestTemplate, WireMock for email
  - [ ] Database: Real data with offers and applications

- [ ] Task 13: Add Monitoring and Metrics (AC: 3, 6)
  - [ ] Add metrics to OfferExpirationService
    - Counter: creditapp.offers.expired.count - total expired offers
    - Gauge: creditapp.offers.active.count - current active offers
    - Histogram: creditapp.offers.validity.duration - days offers valid
    - Timer: creditapp.scheduler.offer-expiration.duration - batch job execution time
  - [ ] Add logging to scheduler
    - INFO: "Batch job: expiring offers..."
    - INFO: "Batch job: {count} offers expired"
    - ERROR: "Batch job: failed to expire offers - {reason}"
  - [ ] Configure metrics export (Prometheus/Micrometer)

- [ ] Task 14: Create Configuration Properties (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Add to application.properties
    - creditapp.scheduler.offer-expiration-enabled=true

    - creditapp.offers.min-validity-minutes=15
  - [ ] Create @Configuration class to load properties
    - OfferExpirationProperties.java
    - Fields: enabled, cron, defaultValidityDays, minValidityMinutes
    - Allow override via environment variables

- [ ] Task 15: Document State Transitions (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Create or update state diagram: OfferStatus transitions
    - CALCULATED --[automatic]-> EXPIRED (expiresAt <= now)
    - ACCEPTED --[automatic]-> EXPIRED_WITH_SELECTION (expiresAt <= now)
    - SUBMITTED --[automatic]-> EXPIRED (expiresAt <= now) [if applicable]
    - Any status --[manual]-> WITHDRAWN (borrower/bank cancels)
    - CALCULATED --[manual]-> REJECTED (bank rejects)
    - Add diagram to docs/architecture/3-frontend-architecture.md or new file

## Dev Notes

### Previous Stories Dependencies
- **Story 3.3**: Offer creation with expiresAt calculation
- **Story 3.4**: Offer retrieval (must exclude expired)
- **Story 3.5**: Offer selection (must check expiration before selection)
- **Story 1.7**: AuditService for logging

### Technology Stack
[Source: architecture/1-system-architecture-overview.md]
- **Scheduler**: Spring @Scheduled, cron expression "0 0 0 * * *" (midnight UTC)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15.4 with Flyway migrations
- **Email Service**: SendGrid API (reuse from Story 1.4 and 3.5)
- **Async Processing**: @Async for email notifications
- **Monitoring**: Micrometer for metrics
- **Transactions**: @Transactional for batch operations

### Batch Job Schedule
[Source: AC: 3]
- **Cron Expression**: "0 0 0 * * *" (daily at midnight UTC)
- **Alternative**: "0 0 0 * * ?" (Quartz-compatible)
- **Components**:
  - OfferExpirationScheduler: Triggers job
  - OfferExpirationService: Performs expiration logic
  - OfferRepository: Queries offers to expire
- **Idempotency**: Job is idempotent (running multiple times same day = same result)

### Status Transitions
[Source: AC: 5]
- **CALCULATED -> EXPIRED**: Time-based, automatic
- **ACCEPTED -> EXPIRED_WITH_SELECTION**: Time-based, automatic + notification
- **SUBMITTED -> EXPIRED**: Time-based (if applicable)
- **Application Status**: OFFER_ACCEPTED -> SUBMITTED (when selected offer expires)
- **Email Notifications**: Sent to bank only if status was ACCEPTED (AC8)

### Expiration Validation
[Source: AC: 2]
- **Check Point 1**: OfferSelectionService.selectOffer() (Story 3.5)
  - Throws OfferExpiredException if expiresAt <= now
  - Returns 410 Gone
- **Check Point 2**: OfferRetrievalService.getOffersForApplication() (Story 3.4)
  - Excludes offers with status = EXPIRED or EXPIRED_WITH_SELECTION
  - Returns empty list if all offers expired
- **Check Point 3**: POST /recalculate-offers endpoint (Story 3.6, Task 7)
  - Allows borrower to request new offers if all expired

### Important Notes
1. **Automatic Expiration**: Batch job runs daily at midnight UTC
2. **Email Notifications**: Only sent if offer was ACCEPTED (borrower selected)
3. **Application Revert**: OFFER_ACCEPTED -> SUBMITTED when selected offer expires
4. **Recalculation**: Borrower can manually recalculate to get fresh offers
5. **State Transition**: CALCULATED -> EXPIRED, ACCEPTED -> EXPIRED_WITH_SELECTION
6. **Audit Trail**: All expirations logged with OFFER_EXPIRED event
7. **Idempotency**: Batch job safe to run multiple times same day
8. **Database Index**: Consider index on offers(expiresAt, status) for query performance
9. **Timezone Handling**: Ensure all timestamps in UTC (ISO 8601)
10. **Error Recovery**: If batch job fails, retry next day or manual trigger available

## Testing
