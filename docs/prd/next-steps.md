# Next Steps

### UX Expert Prompt

"Using the Credit Aggregator MVP PRD (docs/prd.md) as input, please initiate architecture design mode. Focus on:
1. Database schema design for all 5 epics (users, applications, offers, banks, compliance)
2. API contract design for borrower and bank endpoints
3. Spring Boot service architecture with domain boundaries
4. React component structure for borrower and bank portals
5. Security architecture (JWT, encryption, audit logging)
6. Deployment architecture (AWS, Docker, Kubernetes)

Address the technical investigation areas identified in the PRD checklist: event bus selection (Kafka vs. RabbitMQ), encryption strategy (column-level vs. application-level), and Redis caching design for offer calculations."
