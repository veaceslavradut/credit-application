# Goals and Background Context

### Goals

1. Enable borrowers to submit a single loan application and receive comparable credit offers from multiple Moldovan banks in real-time
2. Demonstrate measurable value to pilot banks to justify participation and integration effort
3. Establish regulatory compliance foundation with NBM/CNPF clarity
4. Build two-sided marketplace infrastructure with dual account systems (borrower + bank)
5. Achieve 70%+ application submission rate from signup and 95%+ preliminary offer generation for system reliability validation

### Background Context

The Moldovan lending market currently lacks a centralized credit comparison platform. Borrowers face friction by visiting multiple banks or websites to compare loan terms, while banks struggle to acquire customers cost-effectively through traditional in-branch channels. This platform eliminates that friction by enabling one standardized application to generate preliminary offers from 2-3 Moldovan banks with transparent comparison metrics.

The MVP focuses on validating product-market fit with 2-3 pilot banks before scaling. Success hinges on three pillars: (1) seamless borrower experience that captures application volume, (2) operational efficiency for banks that justifies their participation, and (3) regulatory clarity with Moldova's financial authorities (NBM/CNPF) to de-risk Phase 2 scaling.
